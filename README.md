If you contribute new/changes to images they'll need to be uploaded to the CDN (Sirv) to be available.
Images should also be added to the repo for safe keeping
Note that Sirv has been configured for a 30 day local browser cache time. So if an image gets updated it may be delayed for users unless they force a refresh.

-   Local dev should always use the localhost nextjs server, unless you use a production version locally
